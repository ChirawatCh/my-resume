* Proficient in leveraging retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques and fine-tuning LLMs for domain-specific knowledge.
* Continuously researches AI agents (multi-agents) and evaluates emerging AI/LLM technologies, recommending and implementing improvements.
* **Tools:** Hugging Face, VLLM, Llamaindex 

### Automation and Robotic Process Automation (RPA) Experience
* Developed robotic automation processes for financial and business processes using Python, Power Automate, and Robot Framework.
* Resulted in decreasing error rates and manpower and time consumption.
* Implemented and scheduled robotic processes on cloud flow.
* **Tools:** Python, Power Automate, Robot Framework.

### Performance Test (Load Testing) Experience
* Developed scripts and performed performance testing on APIs and front-end websites using Apache JMeter and Grafana K6 tools.
* Implemented and developed JMeter and K6 scripts into Jenkins for automated load testing and continuous integration and continuous delivery.
* **Tools:** Apache JMeter, Grafana K6, Jenkins 

## Recent Project: AI-Powered Customer Service Chatbot
* Developed an on-premise AI-powered customer service chatbot leveraging a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) workflow with open-source LLM model like Gemma3, LLama-3, Qwen 3, etc.
* Designed and implemented a secure, scalable architecture integrating OAuth 2.0 (OneLogin) for authentication, Chainlit for the user interface, MongoDB and Redis for chat history management, and Qdrant for vector-based document retrieval.
* Enabled real-time, context-aware responses by incorporating a text embedding server, delivering accurate and secure domain-specific support within a fully on-premises deployment.
