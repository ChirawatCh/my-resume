                        <p>Chirawat Chitpakdee is an accomplished AI Workflow Engineer with a strong background in Physical Chemistry, holding an M.Sc. from Kasetsart University and a B.Sc. from Ubon Ratchathani University. He possesses an IELTS Academic score of 6.0.</p>
                        <p>His professional experience spans roles as a Tech Lead Engineer at CP Axtra - Lotus's (current position since 2022), a Digital Economy Promotion Officer at depa, and a Research Assistant at the National Nanotechnology Center, NSTDA.</p>
                        <p>Chirawat specializes in integrating cutting-edge AI solutions with robust automation processes, focusing on cost-efficiency and innovation. His expertise includes performance testing, Robotic Process Automation (RPA), and AI deployment, consistently delivering scalable and reliable systems.</p>
                        <p>His technical proficiencies are extensive, particularly in AI and LLM engineering where he develops systems for enterprise applications like Q&A chatbots and automation algorithms, utilizing tools such as Hugging Face, VLLM, and Llamaindex. He is adept at RAG techniques and fine-tuning LLMs for domain-specific knowledge, while also researching AI agents and evaluating emerging technologies. In RPA, he has developed automation processes using Python, Power Automate, and Robot Framework, significantly reducing errors, manpower, and time. He also has strong experience in performance testing, developing and implementing scripts with Apache JMeter and Grafana K6, and integrating them into Jenkins for automated load testing and CI/CD.</p>
                        <p>A notable recent project involves developing an on-premise AI-powered customer service chatbot using a RAG workflow with the Meta-Llama 3.1 70B FP8 model. This project showcased his ability to design and implement secure, scalable architectures, integrating various technologies for authentication, user interface, chat history management, and vector-based document retrieval.</p>
                        <p>Chirawat's achievements highlight his leadership in AI application development, including creating RAG-based chatbots and providing expert consultation. He has initiated the use of multi-processing in Python to achieve 100% CPU utilization and automated data reconciliation for over 2500 databases. He has also successfully reduced UiPath license costs through RPA implementation and initiated the use of Grafana K6 for performance testing. Furthermore, he has developed advanced algorithms for data cleansing and string-matching, and implemented notification systems within RPA processes. His commitment to knowledge sharing is evident in his efforts to educate teams on performance testing and RPA.</p>
                        <p>His skills span various platforms (GitHub, GitLab, AWS), languages (BASH, Python), data analysis and visualization tools, machine learning (classical and deep learning), AI and LLM libraries, databases, and REST APIs. He has also published an article on LLM inference engine performance testing.</p>
